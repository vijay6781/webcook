      <p className="mb-4">
        In a small village nestled between misty mountains, there lived a young boy named Liam. He was known for his bright eyes and infectious laughter. One chilly evening, while wandering in the woods, Liam stumbled upon an old lantern half-buried in the earth.

        As he picked it up, he noticed a faint glow emanating from within. It was as if the lantern held a piece of the stars. Liam's heart swelled with wonder, and he decided to take it home.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With gentle care, Liam restored the lantern. Every evening, he would light it, and its soft glow would pierce through the darkness, painting the room with a warm embrace. It became a beacon of comfort, a source of solace in lonely nights.
